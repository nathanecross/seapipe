**seapipe** is a Python library for researchers intending to investigate sleep neurophysiology.
The package reads EEG recordings with the purpose of detecting and analysing sleep events, such as *sleep architecture statistics*, *sleep spindles*, *slow oscillations*, *phase amplitude coupling*, and *power spectral analyses*. It offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.
It pulls functions from both the `Wonambi toolbox <https://wonambi-python.github.io/>`_
and the `MNE package <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>`_


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
