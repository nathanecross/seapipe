Phase Amplitude Coupling

Overview
------------
TODO
Phase amplitude coupling (PAC) is a phenomenon where the amplitude of a high-frequency oscillation statistically changes in relation to the phase of a low-frequency oscillation. 
It is a well-studied interaction between brain oscillations in different frequency bands (e.g. slow oscillations and the spindle *sigma* frequency band).
There is no convention yet of how to calculate phase-amplitude coupling.

| Seapipe (via `Tensorpac <https://github.com/EtienneCmb/tensorpac>`_) provides 6 published methods to automatically calculate PAC:

    * `'Mean Vector Length (MVL) [Canolty et al. 2006]' <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1128115>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: The phase-amplitude coupling measure MVL quantifies the coupling between low-frequency phase and high-frequency amplitude by averaging the vectors of the analytic signal, 
       where the length of the mean vector represents the strength of coupling and its direction indicates the phase at which amplitude is strongest. In the absence of coupling, the vectors cancel out, 
       resulting in a short mean vector with no meaningful phase direction.

    * `'Modulation Index (MI) [Tort 2010]' <https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00106.2010>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: This metric is based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, a model-free, information theoretic measure of the distance between two distributions. By calculating Shannon entropy, 
       MI measures the level of irregularity in the distribution of the mean amplitudes of a high frequency signal binned by the concomitant phase of a low frequency signal. The MI ranges from 0 to 1, 
       where 0 indicates a uniform distribution of amplitudes across all phase bins, and 1 signifies a total amplitude concentration inside a single-phase bin.

    * `'Heights Ratio (HR) [Lakatos et al. 2005]' <https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00263.2005>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: Instantaneous power and phase are extracted by wavelet decomposition (Morlet wavelet). Oscillatory amplitude is aligned to oscillatory phase by sorting phase values 
       from ‚àíœÄ to œÄ radians and applying the corresponding permutation vector to rearrange the amplitude time series. Pooled amplitude and frequency values are evaluated statistically by ANOVA. 

    * `'ndPAC [Ozkurt 2012]', <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6184293>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: The normalized direct PAC estimate (ndPAC) uses a statistical threshold to ensure reliable coupling estimates while eliminating distortions from DC components in the data.
       The amplitude vector is normalized by removing its mean and scaling it to have unit variance. For each time point ùëõ, the normalized amplitude is multiplied by the complex phase, creating a set of complex 
       vectors. These vectors are summed over all time points to produce a single complex value. The magnitude (length) of this summed vector measures the consistency of the relationship between amplitude and 
       phase across time.
 
    * `'Phase-Locking Value (PLV) [Penny et al. 2008]' <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165027008003816>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: To calculate the Phase Locking Value (PLV), phase angles are extracted from both a low-frequency filtered signal and the Hilbert-transformed high-frequency amplitude signal, 
       and the phase angle differences are computed for each time point. The coupling strength is determined by the length of the mean vector obtained from averaging these phase difference vectors in the polar plane, 
       where a constant phase lag results in a longer mean vector and stronger coupling.

    * `Gaussian Copula PAC (GCPAC) [Ince 2017 et al. 2013] <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23471>`_:
    
       **Method in brief**: This is an approach to estimate MI with continuous variables (rather than binning data) by leveraging mutual information and Gaussian copula (a statistical structure that expresses a 
       multivariate distribution as the combination of univariate marginal distributions). Amplitude is calculated as the absolute value of the complex number and optionally squared for power. Phase is isolated by 
       normalizing the complex number by its amplitude, resulting in a 2D unit circle representation where Gaussian Copula Mutual Information (GCMI) is applied, ensuring a valid estimate of mutual information (MI) 
       carried by phase without adding extraneous information.


There are also various implemented methods in order to generate the distribution of surrogates and then to correct the PAC for spurious coupling:

    * No surrogates
    * Swap phase / amplitude across trials `[Tort 2010] <https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00106.2010>`_
    * Swap amplitude time blocks `[Bahramisharif 2013] <https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/48/18849>`_
    * Introducing a time lag on phase series `[Canolty et al. 2006] <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1128115>`_


Finally, the true PAC is corrected by the calculated surrogate distribution. Tensorpac includes four types of normalization that should give similar results:

    * Substract the mean of surrogates (1)
    * Divide by the mean of surrogates (2)
    * Substract then divide by the mean of surrogates (3)
    * Substract the mean then divide by the deviation of surrogates (z-score, 4)

Functions to analyse Phase Amplitude Coupling
----------------
| **Analysing phase amplitude coupling and extracting the relevant parameters will involve three functions:**

1) Detect spindles events:  

.. code-block:: python

   project_name.pac()

    This will copy the :ref:`Annotations file` from every ``/sub-XXX/ses-XXX`` in ``<xml_dir>`` to ``<root_dir>/OUT/pac/`` and calculate PAC. Output parameters will be stored in ``_pac_parameters.csv``
