Slow Oscillations
=====

.. _overview:

Overview
------------
Slow oscillations (SOs) are biphasic waves corresponding to the alternation between two stable membranes potential levels (UP states = depolarization and 
DOWN states = hyperpolarization).Oscillating below 1.25 Hz, SOs are generated during NREM2 and NREM3.

| Slow oscillations can be detected as events and their characteristics (see definitions in section :ref:`Output`) can be extracted across NREM (N2+N3), 
per stage and/or per cycle.

| We propose 3 standardized published methods to automatically detect SOs :
    * *Staresina et al. (2015)*: recommended for event detection (<1.25Hz) with amplitude adapted per individual per channel
    Method in brief: 1. Filter the signal (two-pass FIR bandpass filter, 0.5â€“1.25 Hz, order = 3); 2. A positive-to-negative zero crossing and a subsequent 
    negative-to-positive zero crossing separated by 0.8-2.0 sec; 3. Top 25% of events with the largest amplitudes for trough-to-peak amplitude between two 
    positive-to-negative zero crossings. `see reference`_.
.. _see reference: https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4119

    * *Ngo et al. (2013)*: recommended for event detection (<3.5Hz) with amplitude adapted per individual across several channels (average)
    Method in brief: 1. Filter the signal (lowpass filter, 3.5 Hz); 2. A positive-to-negative zero crossing and a subsequent negative-to-positive zero crossing 
    separated by 0.833-2.0 sec ; 3. A negative peak amplitude lower than 1.25 times the mean negative peak amplitude per subject. `see reference`_.

    * *Massimini et al. (2004)*: recommended for detection of textbook SOs (75uV peak-to-peak, 1-4Hz)
    Method in brief: 1. Filter the signal (bandpass, 0.1-4 Hz); 2. A positive-to-negative zero crossing and a subsequent negative-to-positive zero crossing 
    separated by 0.3-1.0 sec; 3. A negative peak between the two zero crossings with voltage less than -80 uV,; 4. A negative-to-positive peak-to-peak 
    amplitude >140 uV. `see reference`_.

**You will need to run three functions:**

1) Detect SOs events
    * It will copy the .xml from ``root_dir/OUT/staging/`` to ``root_dir/OUT/slowwave/`` and write events detected 

.. code-block:: python

   project.detect_slow_oscillations()


2) Export event characteristics 
    * It will extract a .csv file per channel and/or stage in the subject and session folders in ``root_dir/OUT/slowwave/`` 

.. code-block:: python

   project_name.export_eventparams()
 
3) Create datasets combining all the subjects
   * It will combine all .csv into a single dataset (one row per subject) per session, stage and channel in ``root_dir/OUT/datasets/``

.. code-block:: python

   project_name.event_dataset()
