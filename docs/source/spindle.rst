Overview
------------
TODO
Slow oscillations (SOs) are coherent waves corresponding to the alternation between biphasic membrane potential levels (UP states = depolarization 
and DOWN states = hyperpolarization). Oscillating below ~1 Hz, SOs are generated during sleep stages NREM2 and NREM3.

| Slow oscillations can be detected as events and their characteristics (see definitions in section :ref:`Output<Outputs of Slow Oscillations>`) can be extracted across NREM (NREM2+NREM3), per stage and/or per cycle.

| Seapipe provides 4 published methods to automatically detect SOs:

    * `Staresina et al. (2015) <https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4119>`_: SO detection (<1.25Hz) with an adapted amplitude criteria per individual and channel.
    
       Method in brief:

        1. Filter the signal (FIR bandpass filter, 0.5â€“1.25 Hz, order = 3); 

        2. Identify events with a positive-to-negative zero crossing and a subsequent negative-to-positive zero crossing separated by 0.8-2 sec;

        3. Keep the top 25% of events with the largest trough-to-peak amplitudes. 




.. _Functions:
Functions to detect spindles
----------------
| **Detecting spindles and extracting their parameters will involve three functions:**

1) Detect spindles events:  

.. code-block:: python

   project.detect_spindles()
|
    This will copy the :ref:`Annotations file` from every ``/sub-XXX/ses-XXX`` in ``<xml_dir>`` to ``<root_dir>/OUT/spindle/`` and write in the detected events. 
|
2) Export event characteristics: 

.. code-block:: python

   project_name.export_eventparams()
|   
    This will extract a ``.csv`` file for every channel and/or stage and/or cycle into every ``/sub-XXX/ses-XXX`` directory in ``<root_dir>/OUT/slowwave/`` 
|
3) Create datasets combining all the subjects: 

.. code-block:: python

   project_name.event_dataset()
|
    This will combine all of the ``.csv`` files from the previous step into a single dataset (one row per subject) ``<root_dir>/OUT/datasets/``
|

            * Entering ``Manual`` will point to the *chanset_peaks* columns in the :ref:`tracking file<Tracking File>`. It will extract parameters of the events set up in **evt_name** with *_adap* at the end of the name.

    **adap_bw** *(str)*
        * Size of the frequency range around sigma peak frequency when entering ``Auto``or ``Manual`` to **adap_bands**

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``4``meaning 2Hz on both side of the sigma peak frequency

            * Enter a even number 

    **params** *(str or dict)*
        * The names of specific parameters to export

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``all`` which will export all characteristics (see :ref:`Output`) -  *Recommended* 

            * To specify only specific parameters to export, enter a `dictionary <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_ with ``True`` or ``False`` for each parameter (e.g., ``params = ['dur':True, 'minamp':False, 'maxamp':False, 'ptp':True, 'rms':False, 'power':True, 'peakpf':False, 'energy':False, 'peakef':False]``)

    **epoch_dur** *(int)*
        * Options to change the denominator (duration) for the *spindle density* index 

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``30`` (this infers 30-second epochs)

            * Entering a number (e.g., ``60``) will imply that the SO density value equals the number of events per this time period (e.g. per *60 seconds*)

    **outfile** *(str or logical)*
        * Logging of event parameter export

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``True`` which will create a logfile *export_params_{method}_{datetime}_log.txt* in ``<root_dir>/OUT/audit/logs/``

     .. note::
        By default

        * *export_eventparams* cannot extract spindle characteristics without required arguments for ``evt_name``.

        * *export_eventparams* will extract characteristics per stage (NREM2 vs NREM3). If you want the extraction for NREM2+NREM3 combined as well, re-run *export_eventparams* with ``concat_stage = True``.

        * *export_eventparams* will extract characteristics for the whole-night. If you want the extraction per cycle, re-run *export_eventparams* with ``concat_cycle = False``.

            * Entering a list of event names (e.g ``['Ray2015', 'Lacourse2018']``) will create a dataset for each event *separately*

*Positional arguments:*

    **stage** *(list)*
        * Stages of interest

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``None`` which will create datasets for all stages extracted in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>`

            * Entering a list of stages (e.g., ``['NREM3']``) will only export parameters for the events in this specific stage

                .. note::
                    This will only work if the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>` was run with ``concat_stage = False``

    **concat_stage** *(logical)*
        * Concatenation options for stages

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``False`` which will create datasets per stage (NREM2 vs NREM3) *separately* (saving each stage as a separate ``.csv`` output file)

            * Entering ``True`` will concatenate (i.e., merge) all stages before exporting the parameters of the spindle events

            .. note::
                Pay caution to how the argument ``concat_stage`` was defined in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>` .
                If in this step (**Create datasets**) the argument is set to: ``concat_stage = False``, but in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>` this was set to ``concat_stage = True`` , then this will fail as the spindle events have not been exported for stages combined.

            * Entering ``False`` create datasets per sleep cycle *separately* (saving each cycle as a separate ``.csv`` output file)

            .. note::
                Similar to ``concat_stage`` - pay caution to how the argument ``concat_cycle`` was defined in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>` .
                If in this step (**Create datasets**) the argument is set to: ``concat_cycle = False``, but in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>` this was set to ``concat_cycle = True`` , then this will fail as the spindle events have not been exported for cycle combined. The previous step will need to be re-run with ``concat_cycle = False``

    **cycle_idx** *(NoneType or tuple)*
        * Cycles of interest

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``None`` which will infer to not take into consideration the cycle and either extract cycle for the whole night if ``concat_cycle = True`` 
            or for all the cycles if ``concat_cycle = False``

            * Entering list of cycle numbers (e.g., ``[1,2,3]``) will extract the spindle parameters for those cycles only. It requires that you have 
            defined ``cycle_idx`` during :ref:`export event parameters<Export spindle characteristics>` and have also set up ``concat_cycle = False``.

    **grp_name** *(str)*
        * Name of the tab in the :ref:`Annotations file` where the detected events are saved 

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * If entering a list of group names (e.g., ``['eeg_hemiR']``), ensure that this matches ``grp_name`` used in the :ref:`export event parameters step<Export spindle characteristics>`

    **params** *(str or dict)*
        * The names of specific parameters to export into the dataset 

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``all`` which will export all characteristics (see :ref:`Output`) -  *Recommended* 

            * To specify only specific parameters to export, enter a `dictionary <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_ with ``True`` or ``False`` for each parameter (e.g., ``params = ['dur':True, 'minamp':False, 'maxamp':False, 'ptp':True, 'rms':False, 'power':True, 'peakpf':False, 'energy':False, 'peakef':False]``)

    **outfile** *(str or logical)*
        * Logging of event parameter export

        * *Acceptable options:*

            * Default is ``True`` which will create a logfile *event_dataset_{method}_{datetime}_log.txt* in ``<root_dir>/OUT/audit/logs/``

            * Entering a string ``<custom_outfile_name.txt>`` will save the logfile under that custom name
            
            * Entering ``False`` won't save a logfile
